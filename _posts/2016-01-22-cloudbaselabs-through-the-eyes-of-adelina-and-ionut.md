One day left to apply for CloudbaseLABS in Iași. We'd like to give you more impressions from former participants, both of which have become important contributors of open-source projects and trainers in projects such as these.

Today we will share with you the experience of Adelina and Ionuț, both Cloud Engineers at [Cloudbase Solutions](1) and former applicants of our workshops in Timișoara.

[Adelina](2) was a 4th year student in search for her first job, so she applied to our workshops two years ago. Shortly after the lab ended she got hired and started contributing code to ‪[OpenStack](3)‬.
In Iași she will be a co-trainer on the project, covering all of the ‪[Python](4)‬ labs and also talking about ‪[Windows](5)‬ and ‎[PowerShell‬](6). Here is a short testimonial describing her experience:

> "I didn't know much about what Cloudbase Solutions was doing, but the idea of working in Python and working on ‪#‎cloud‬ projects sounded pretty interesting, so i chose to apply at their lab. I passed the test and the interview and there i was. The labs themselves were pretty challenging. They covered and extended basic topics about almost everything i have studied during university, put them into a practical context, and really provided a great insight into what OpenStack and the cloud are. If you are interested in learning about the cloud, these labs are a great place to start."

[Ionuț](7) also attended our CloudbaseLABS workshops two years ago driven by his curiosity to learn something new. This is how he experienced the project:

> "At that time, I was looking for something new and challenging. I ended up learning so many things about networking, ‪Python‬, OpenStack, ‪Linux‬ and ‎Windows‬. This knowledge proved to be very useful during my everyday job. The overall experience was really nice. I recommend enrolling in projects such as these if you like working in a dynamic environment, want to learn more about cloud computing and at the same time improve your knowledge in the most used operating systems today - Linux and Windows."

And of course, we're leaving you with a thought of ours. Sometimes you feel like the gap in knowledge between you and your peers is huge, especially if you are a first year student and you are competing with older students with more experience than you. We're telling you that that doesn't matter that much, as long as you are passionate enough and willing to learn. 

The most important thing is to be smart, a thing which cannot be measured by grades or years of experience. And we're also telling you this: the road from novice to hero is shorter than you know. In one year you can grow from participating to projects such as these, to becoming trainers and mentoring a group of new, enthusiastic students such as yourself.

Don't forget to apply to [CloudbaseLABS @Iași](/iasi/#apply-now) until January 23, to convince yourself!
